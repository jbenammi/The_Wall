This was made during a code assignment from Coding Dojo by myself in 24 hours with 12 hours of coding/styling.
The wall is a posting/commenting platform that was built with Flask, SQL and Python. The main functionality is as follows:

•	User has the ability to register account. 
•	Bcrypt used for password encryption. 
•	User have the ability to log in / logout. 
•	User can post a own messages on the wall with a timestamp. 
•	User cannot delete other users posts. 
•	User can delete message if it is not older than 30 minutes. 
•	User can always delete own comments. 
•	Validations are split where required on the server side. 
•	Delete cascading is implemented in SQL

This was a basic assignment and the functionality highlighted above was implemented to satisfy the assignment criteria. Once completed with the course, I intend to add additional features.
